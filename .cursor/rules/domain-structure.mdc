description: Domains live in `app/Domain/` and follow a structured modular pattern.

- Each domain resides in `app/Domain/DomainName/`.
- Should typically include:
  - `Model.php` with Doctrine-style annotations (for documentation, IDE support, etc.).
  - `DTOs/` using `Spatie\LaravelData\Data` (camelCase properties).
  - `Requests/` for input validation.
  - `Controllers/` with RESTful CRUD logic.
  - `Actions/` for custom operations outside basic CRUD.
  - `Policies/` to encapsulate authorization logic.
- Keep structure consistent across domains for maintainability.
