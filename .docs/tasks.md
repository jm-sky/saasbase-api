# Tasks

## 1. [x] Add middleware to set locale based on Accept Language header. 

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\App;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Config;

class SetLocaleFromHeader
{
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        // Pobierz listÄ™ z configu
        $supportedLocales = Config::get('app.supported_locales', ['en']);

        // Laravelowy helper do analizy Accept-Language
        $locale = $request->getPreferredLanguage($supportedLocales);

        if ($locale) {
            App::setLocale($locale);
        }

        return $next($request);
    }
}
```

---

## 2. [x] Add seeders for all models. I need seeder for skill categories and skills, let's start with IT area. I want to have a demo with few users, few tenants, some contractors, products, projects & tasks.

- **Subtasks**:
  - Create seeder for skill categories and skills (IT area).
  - Create seeder for users (demo users, include users with different roles).
  - Create seeder for tenants (few tenants).
  - Create seeder for contractors (few contractors).
  - Create seeder for products (demo products).
  - Create seeder for projects (few demo projects).
  - Create seeder for tasks (few tasks related to projects).
  - Create seeder for Vat rates - use Polish vat rates as example.
   ```jsonc
   // database/seeders/data/polish_vat_rates.json
   [
     { "rate": 0.23, "name": "23%",     "is_default": true },
     { "rate": 0.08,  "name": "8%",       "is_default": false },
     { "rate": 0.05,  "name": "5%", "is_default": false },
     { "rate": 0.0,  "name": "0%",          "is_default": false }
   ]
   ```

---

## 3. [x] Add countries to Country seeders JSON file (European countries, and most large countries).
- **Note**: We can include all countries if performance is not impacted.
- **Subtasks**:
  - Review existing Country seeder.
  - Add all countries (Europe and large countries) to the seeder.
  - Test seeding functionality.

---

## 4. [ ] Add routes & actions for current user - change settings, reset password etc.
- **Suggested**: Use Actions instead of controller methods for better organization.
- **Subtasks**:
  - Create actions for changing user settings (username, email, etc.).
  - Create action for resetting password.
  - Create action for updating user profile. 
  - Create action for updating timezone. 
  - Create action for updating notified preferences.
  - Implement action for changing language preference.
  - Implement validation for user settings actions.

   ```php
   // routes/api.php
   // Use actions instead of controllers 
   // Add timezone & notification prefs. 
   Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')->group(function () {
       Route::put('user/settings', [UserSettingsController::class, 'update']);
       Route::patch('user/language', [UserSettingsController::class, 'changeLanguage']);
   });
   Route::post('user/password-reset', [PasswordResetController::class, 'sendResetLink']);
   Route::put('user/password', [PasswordResetController::class, 'resetPassword']);
   ```
   **Done when:**  
   - All four endpoints accept and return JSON, apply validation via FormRequest or Actions, and return appropriate HTTP codes.  
   - Tests cover success and failure cases.

---

## 5. [x] Add trait (BelongsToTenant) that applies a global scope for models with `tenant_id`. We'll store `tenant_id` in session or JWT for security.  
- **Note**: User does not have tenant_id; a user can belong to many tenants, not just one.
- **Subtasks**:
  - Create a `BelongsToTenant` trait that applies a global scope for models.
  - Implement session or JWT storage for tenant identification.
  - Refactor models that should be tenant-scoped.
  - Add unit tests for tenant scoping.

---

## 6. [ ] Refactor foreign keys. i.e. refer to country code (pl, de) instead of id. Analyse.  
- **Note**: It may not be more efficient, but we would immediately see the country name instead of an anonymous ID.
- **Subtasks**:
  - Review foreign key usage for countries.
  - Replace country IDs with country codes (pl, de) in relevant models.
  - Update migrations for country references.
  - Review and update the database schema if necessary.
  - Test functionality to ensure foreign key relations are properly handled with country codes.

---

## 7. [x] Implement standardized filtering and sorting with Spatie Query Builder to index method in all CRUD controllers. 

Create trait
```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers\Concerns;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Pagination\LengthAwarePaginator;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Spatie\QueryBuilder\QueryBuilder;
use Spatie\QueryBuilder\AllowedFilter;

trait HasIndexQuery
{
    /**
     * The model class to query.
     */
    protected string $modelClass;

    /**
     * Allowed filters for the query.
     */
    protected array $filters = [];

    /**
     * Allowed sorts for the query.
     */
    protected array $sorts = [];

    /**
     * Default sort option.
     */
    protected string $defaultSort = '-id';

    /**
     * Create the base query using Spatie QueryBuilder.
     */
    public function getIndexQuery(Request $request): Builder
    {
        return QueryBuilder::for($this->modelClass)
            ->allowedFilters($this->filters)
            ->allowedSorts($this->sorts)
            ->defaultSort($this->defaultSort);
    }

    /**
     * Return paginated results.
     */
    public function getIndexPaginator(Request $request): LengthAwarePaginator
    {
        return $this->getIndexQuery($request)->paginate()->appends($request->query());
    }
}
```

Create DateRangeFilter
```php
namespace App\Filters;

use Spatie\QueryBuilder\Filters\Filter;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

class DateRangeFilter implements Filter
{
    protected string $column;

    public function __construct(string $column = 'date')
    {
        $this->column = $column;
    }

    public function __invoke(Builder $query, $value, string $property)
    {
        $dates = explode(',', $value);
        $from = $dates[0] ?? null;
        $to = $dates[1] ?? null;

        if ($from && !$to) {
            $query->whereDate($this->column, '=', $from);
        } elseif ($from && $to) {
            $query->whereDate($this->column, '>=', $from)
                  ->whereDate($this->column, '<=', $to);
        }
    }
}
```

Use this trait in controllers, fill `$filters` with all columns of domain model, and some relations if needed. Use DateRangeFilter for date fields.

Create something like `Search[model]Request` with validation for those filters.

Add tests.

  - Ensure compatibility with tools like Swagger UI and Postman.
  - Preferably automate via Artisan command or during CI build.

---

## 21. [] **Migrate UUID to ULID**
  - Replace UUID identifiers with ULID across all models that currently use UUID.
  - Check latest Laravel documentation (v12) for native Laravel support for ULID (in migration, validation, model trait) 
  - Create a new Laravel trait similar to `HasUuid` but using ULID (e.g. `HasUlid`) (if needed).
  - Update model factories, migrations, and any related seeding logic to use ULID.
  - Ensure compatibility with existing tools like Spatie Media Library, Horizon, etc.
  - Validate sortability and uniqueness of ULIDs across tenants and environments.
    - Migrations update PK types to `ulid()`.  
    - Factories use `Str::ulid()`.  

---

## 22. [] **Add Admin API Endpoints**
  - Introduce new API namespace: `/api/v1/admin/...`.
  - Allow full CRUD access to global models and dictionary tables outside of tenant scope.
  - Example resources: tenants, users, invoices, default project/task statuses, units, VAT rates, etc.
  - Ensure all admin endpoints are protected by proper authorization middleware (e.g. `is_admin`).
  - Use separate controllers or route groups to avoid conflicts with tenant-scoped logic.
  - Tag admin routes accordingly in OpenAPI documentation for visibility and clarity. 

---
## 22. Refresh Token Support in JWTAuth

### Goal
Implement full support for refresh tokens in a Laravel app using the `tymon/jwt-auth` package.

### Requirements

1. **TTL Configuration**:
   - Access token: 15 minutes
   - Refresh token: 7 days (10080 minutes)

2. **Endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/auth/login` â€” returns access token and refresh token
   - `POST /api/auth/refresh` â€” accepts refresh token and returns new access token
   - `POST /api/auth/logout` â€” invalidates current access token (and optionally the refresh token)

3. **Security**:
   - Refresh token should be stored on the client side (preferably in an HttpOnly cookie, or as a returned JSON field)
   - Stateless approach: no server-side storage of refresh tokens unless explicitly extended

4. **Middleware**:
   - Every request should validate the access token
   - Handle "token expired" errors with a clear path to refresh

### Extras
- Add unit and integration tests for login, refresh, and logout flows.
- Optionally create a dedicated service (e.g., `AuthService`) to encapsulate token logic.

### Definition of Done
- All endpoints work as described.
- Tokens are issued and refreshed respecting their TTLs.
- Tests cover the main use cases.
- API documentation updated (OpenAPI/Swagger or README).
