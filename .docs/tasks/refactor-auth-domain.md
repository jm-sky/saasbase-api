## Objectives
1. Analyze the current domain structure and identify potential areas for improvement
2. Evaluate if the current organization follows best practices
3. Propose a refactoring strategy if needed

## Specific Areas to Analyze
1. **Domain Cohesion**
   - Evaluate if all current responsibilities belong in the Auth domain
   - Identify potential candidates for separate domains
   - Assess coupling between different components

2. **Current Responsibilities**
   - Authentication (login, 2FA, OAuth)
   - User profile management
   - API key management
   - Application invitations
   - Email verification
   - Password reset
   - User sessions
   - User settings

3. **Potential Refactoring Options**
   - Option 1: Split into separate domains
     - Auth (core authentication)
     - User (profile management)
     - Api (key management)
     - Invitations
   
   - Option 2: Reorganize into subdomains
     ```
     Auth/
     ├── Core/
     ├── Profile/
     ├── Api/
     └── Invitations/
     ```

## Deliverables
1. Analysis of current structure
2. Recommendation for refactoring (if needed)
3. Detailed migration plan if refactoring is recommended
4. Impact assessment of proposed changes

## Success Criteria
1. Clear separation of concerns
2. Maintainable and scalable structure
3. Reduced coupling between components
4. Preserved functionality
5. Improved code organization

## Constraints
1. Must maintain backward compatibility
2. Should minimize disruption to existing functionality
3. Consider team size and organization
4. Account for current development velocity

## Additional Considerations
1. Team size and organization
2. Rate of change in different areas
3. Complexity of each subdomain
4. Current development practices
5. Future scalability needs
