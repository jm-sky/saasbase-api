# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Tenant Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement multi-tenancy support with tenant isolation.
# Details:
Create Tenant model and migration. Implement tenant-specific configurations and resource isolation. Ensure tenant context is automatically set in all operations.

# Test Strategy:
Test tenant creation, configuration, and data isolation. Verify tenant-specific access controls.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Tenant Model and Migration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the Tenant model with necessary fields and create the corresponding database migration.
### Details:
Use an ORM to define the Tenant model with fields like id, name, and any other relevant attributes. Generate and run the migration to create the tenants table in the database.

## 2. Implement Tenant Configuration Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop a system to manage tenant-specific configurations.
### Details:
Create a configuration model or table to store tenant-specific settings. Implement CRUD operations for managing these configurations.

## 3. Set Up Resource Isolation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Ensure that resources are isolated per tenant.
### Details:
Implement middleware or interceptors to enforce tenant isolation at the database and application levels. Use tenant ID to scope queries and operations.

## 4. Automatically Set Tenant Context [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.3
### Description: Ensure that the tenant context is automatically set in all operations.
### Details:
Develop middleware to extract tenant information from the request (e.g., from headers or subdomains) and set it in the context for all subsequent operations.

## 5. Integrate and Test Multi-Tenancy Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Integrate all components and perform end-to-end testing of the multi-tenancy support.
### Details:
Combine all implemented features and perform thorough testing to ensure that multi-tenancy works as expected. Include performance and security testing.

## 6. Design Tenant Isolation Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a detailed plan for isolating tenant data.
### Details:
Identify the mechanisms for data isolation, such as separate databases, schemas, or row-level security.

## 7. Implement Tenant Isolation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.6
### Description: Develop the code to enforce tenant isolation.
### Details:
Write the necessary code to ensure that each tenant's data is isolated from others. This may involve database configuration and application-level checks.

## 8. Set Up Tenant Context Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.7
### Description: Develop a system to manage tenant context.
### Details:
Create a mechanism to switch between different tenant contexts, ensuring that the correct data is accessed and modified based on the current tenant.

## 9. Conduct Integration Testing for Tenant Isolation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.8
### Description: Test the integration of tenant isolation and context management.
### Details:
Perform thorough integration testing to ensure that tenant data is correctly isolated and that context switching works as expected. Include edge cases and stress testing.

## 10. Document Tenant Isolation and Context Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.9
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the tenant isolation and context management system.
### Details:
Write detailed documentation covering the design, implementation, and testing of the tenant isolation and context management system. Include best practices and troubleshooting guides.

## 11. Design Multi-Tenancy Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a detailed architecture design for multi-tenancy.
### Details:
Include data isolation strategies, tenant-specific configurations, and security considerations.

## 12. Implement Data Isolation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.11
### Description: Develop mechanisms to isolate tenant data.
### Details:
Use separate databases, schemas, or tables for each tenant.

## 13. Configure Tenant-Specific Settings [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.11
### Description: Set up configurations specific to each tenant.
### Details:
Include tenant-specific settings for features, permissions, and customizations.

## 14. Develop Tenant Onboarding Process [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
### Description: Create a process for onboarding new tenants.
### Details:
Include steps for data setup, configuration, and initial access.

## 15. Test Multi-Tenancy Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.12, 3.13, 3.14
### Description: Conduct thorough testing of the multi-tenancy features.
### Details:
Ensure data isolation, tenant-specific configurations, and onboarding process work as expected.
