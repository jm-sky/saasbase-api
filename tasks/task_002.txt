# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Core Authentication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the authentication module with email/password, JWT, and OAuth integration.
# Details:
1. Create user authentication routes and controllers.
2. Implement JWT-based authentication.
3. Integrate OAuth providers for social logins.
4. Set up password reset functionality.
5. Implement two-factor authentication (2FA).

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login, password reset, and 2FA. Verify JWT token generation and validation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create User Authentication Routes and Controllers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic routes and controllers for user authentication, including registration, login, and logout.
### Details:
Use an Express.js router to define the routes. Create controllers to handle the logic for user registration, login, and logout. Ensure that the routes are protected where necessary.

## 2. Implement JWT-based Authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the JWT-based authentication mechanism to secure API endpoints.
### Details:
Generate JWT tokens upon successful login. Implement middleware to verify tokens on protected routes. Store tokens securely on the client side.

## 3. Integrate OAuth Providers for Social Logins [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add support for OAuth providers like Google, Facebook, and GitHub for social logins.
### Details:
Use OAuth libraries to handle the authentication flow. Implement callbacks to handle the OAuth response and generate JWT tokens. Update the user model to store OAuth provider information.

## 4. Set Up Password Reset Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the password reset feature to allow users to reset their passwords.
### Details:
Create routes and controllers for password reset requests, token generation, and password update. Send reset emails with secure tokens. Ensure that tokens are valid and single-use.

## 5. Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add two-factor authentication to enhance security for user accounts.
### Details:
Integrate a 2FA library to generate and verify OTPs. Update the user model to store 2FA settings. Implement routes and controllers to handle 2FA setup and verification.
