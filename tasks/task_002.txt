# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Authentication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core authentication system with JWT-based authentication.
# Details:
Create User model and migration. Implement registration, login, and password reset functionality. Set up JWT authentication middleware. Ensure email and phone number verification processes are in place.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login, password reset, and JWT token generation. Verify email and phone number verification workflows.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create User Model and Migration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the User model with necessary fields and create the database migration.
### Details:
Use an ORM like Sequelize or TypeORM to define the User model. Include fields such as username, email, password hash, phone number, and verification status. Generate the migration script to create the corresponding table in the database.

## 2. Implement User Registration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the registration endpoint to create new users.
### Details:
Create an API endpoint for user registration. Hash the user's password before saving it to the database. Send a verification email or SMS to the user's provided email or phone number.

## 3. Implement User Login and JWT Authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the login endpoint and set up JWT authentication middleware.
### Details:
Create an API endpoint for user login. Verify the user's credentials and generate a JWT token upon successful authentication. Set up middleware to protect routes using the JWT token.

## 4. Implement Password Reset Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Develop the password reset process including request and reset endpoints.
### Details:
Create an API endpoint to request a password reset. Generate a reset token and send it to the user's email or phone number. Create another endpoint to reset the password using the reset token.

## 5. Implement Email and Phone Number Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Develop the verification process for email and phone number.
### Details:
Create API endpoints to verify the user's email and phone number. Generate verification tokens and send them to the user. Update the user's verification status upon successful verification.

## 6. User Registration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a user registration process.
### Details:
Implement a secure user registration form that captures necessary user information and stores it securely in the database.

## 7. User Login [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.6
### Description: Implement the user login process.
### Details:
Create a login form that authenticates users using their credentials. Generate a JWT token upon successful authentication.

## 8. Password Reset [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.6
### Description: Develop the password reset functionality.
### Details:
Implement a password reset process that allows users to request a password reset, verify their identity, and set a new password.

## 9. JWT Token Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.7
### Description: Verify JWT tokens for authenticated requests.
### Details:
Create middleware to verify JWT tokens for each protected route. Ensure the token is valid and not expired.

## 10. Token Expiry and Refresh [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.9
### Description: Handle token expiry and refresh.
### Details:
Implement a mechanism to refresh JWT tokens before they expire. Ensure secure handling of refresh tokens.

## 11. Design JWT Authentication Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a detailed design for the JWT authentication flow, including token generation, validation, and refresh mechanisms.
### Details:
Include diagrams and documentation for the authentication process.

## 12. Implement Token Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.11
### Description: Develop the backend logic to generate JWT tokens upon successful user authentication.
### Details:
Ensure tokens include necessary claims and are securely signed.

## 13. Implement Token Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.11, 2.12
### Description: Create middleware to validate JWT tokens on protected routes.
### Details:
Check token signature, expiration, and claims.

## 14. Implement Token Refresh Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.11, 2.12, 2.13
### Description: Develop a mechanism to refresh JWT tokens without requiring re-authentication.
### Details:
Use refresh tokens to issue new access tokens.

## 15. Implement Security Measures for JWT [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14
### Description: Add security measures to protect against common JWT vulnerabilities.
### Details:
Include measures like token revocation, secure storage, and protection against token theft.

## 16. Test Authentication System [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15
### Description: Conduct thorough testing of the JWT authentication system to ensure security and reliability.
### Details:
Include unit tests, integration tests, and security audits.
