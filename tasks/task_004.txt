# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop RBAC system for user permissions.
# Details:
Create Role and Permission models. Implement policies to enforce access controls at the model and action level. Ensure role inheritance through the organizational hierarchy.

# Test Strategy:
Test role assignment, permission enforcement, and role inheritance. Verify access controls for different user roles.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Role and Permission Models [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the data models for Roles and Permissions.
### Details:
Create database tables or collections for Roles and Permissions. Define relationships between them. Implement basic CRUD operations for these models.

## 2. Implement Role Inheritance [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Enable role inheritance through the organizational hierarchy.
### Details:
Design and implement a mechanism to inherit permissions from parent roles. Update the Role model to support inheritance.

## 3. Define Access Control Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create policies to enforce access controls at the model level.
### Details:
Develop a policy engine that checks user roles and permissions against defined access control rules. Integrate this engine with the application's data access layer.

## 4. Enforce Access Controls at the Action Level [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Implement access controls for specific actions within the application.
### Details:
Update the application's controllers or handlers to check user permissions before executing actions. Integrate with the policy engine defined in the previous step.

## 5. Test and Validate RBAC System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.4
### Description: Comprehensively test the RBAC system to ensure it works as expected.
### Details:
Conduct end-to-end testing to validate role inheritance, access control policies, and action-level permissions. Perform security testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
